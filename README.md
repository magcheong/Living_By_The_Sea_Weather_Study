# Living_By_The_Sea_Weather_Study
'Living By The Sea. Should I?' is a data analysis study on weather.

Introduction:

I have been mulling over this for some time now: where shall I move to? Perhaps it is not such a big deal since Singapore is such a small country; there is not a huge difference from town to town. Proximity to the Central Business District at the south of the island is one of the main considerations for many but holds no importance to me. I dream of a place that is away from the hustling and bustling of city living.

Being a small city-state, there is not a lot of options for a quiet life. Living near the sea draws me. I imagine: facing the sea with my eyes closed after a long day’s work, I listen to the murmurs of the sea and stand captivated by a conversation I do not understand; the gentle cool breeze brushes me by and carries with it all the cares of the day. 

Oh but is it warm damp air blowing against my face? Will humidity be higher near the coast? It’s supposed to be cooler near the sea, right? Alright, hold on to the cheque first.

One might argue that sitting on the equator, Singapore will hardly notice any temperature difference across the island, and that even if there is, difference of a few degrees will not matter. Perhaps? In a tropical country as Singapore, I would surely go for the coolest option possible.

My curiosity is piqued. I need to satisfy this curiosity: is it indeed cooler near the coast?

Should I move near the coast?
